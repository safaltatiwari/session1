# First Program
# calculate Area of circle
# A = pier^2
#   Area of circle = pie*radius*2

pie = 3.1415
Diam = 14
radi = diam/2

# input pie value
# input raidius vlue
# calcualte area by:
# pie times r sqaure
# dispaly area of circle

input miles value
input name of the user
convert kms to miles by:
 miles is 1.6*kms
display kms with name
